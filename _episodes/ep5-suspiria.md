excerpt: Happy Halloween everybody. We hope you are doing some safe Trick or Treating if it is possible, or finding another way to celebrate. If you ended up watching this crazy cult film, we hope you got something worthwhile, because we are still searching for meaning. 
summary: This week, in celebration of Halloween, we decided to watch Luca Guadagnino’s 2018 horror film - Suspiria. This fever-dream film attempts to reconcile horror, history, and mystery leveraging a nearly all-female cast and cinematic stylings of 1970’s horror cinema. In this episode we address the poignant historical events of 1977 Europe that scaffold the plot, the use and meaning of witches in the film, and the body horror genre. Join us for a riveting discussion, and at your own discretion, stream Suspiria on Amazon Prime Video!
