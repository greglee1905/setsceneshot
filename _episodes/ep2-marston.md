excerpt:  What is up everybody! Welcome to another episode of set. Today we are getting into a film we saw this week called Profe. Its currently available for rent on amazon prime and free on hulu if you have that premium subscription. This kinky film depicts the true origin story of an American Icon, Wonder Woman, who was widely inspired by her author's polyamorous relationship and their engagement in BDSM. 
summary: “Strap in” as we take on the BDSM-laced story in Angela Robinson’s Professor Marston and the Wonder Women.  Does historical accuracy matter when writing biopics?  Should we give equal weight to aesthetics and narrative when analyzing film?  In this episode we explore those questions alongside a deep dive into 20th-century psychology.  Stream Professor Marston and the Wonder Women on Hulu and Amazon Prime Video, and tune in for our analysis on this kinky film!
