excerpt: Dare you to play this episode... You won't do it will you. pathetic.  This week we examine toxic masculinity through The Art of Self Defense! We contemplate the role martial arts in the rise of the Hollywood blockbuster and debate the pervasiveness of masculinity in culture. At its best, The Art of Self Defense provides fantastic situational comedy although it fails to define a meaningful feminine perspective. Greg - 7/10 || Kiki - 7.2533333/10
