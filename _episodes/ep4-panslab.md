excerpt:  "El laberinto del fauno. I apologize. I know I butchered it but ya know we out here we tryin. That's the name for Pan's Labyrinth the movie that is up for debate this week. I remember my parents saw it and they came home and talked about two things: one - the captain who was brutally violent, my mom hated it and the creepiness of this pale man figure."
