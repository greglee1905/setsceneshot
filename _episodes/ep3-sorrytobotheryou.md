excerpt:  What's up everybody! We're back at it again. This is the third episode of sss. We are super excited to be here today. We are talking about Sorry to Bother You - an insane movie. Honestly, one of the biggest crazy movies I've seen. I watched it with family and by the end, everyone was looking at me like, "what the heck was that". 
summary: Our third episode is on Boots Rileyâ€™s 2018 whirlwind film, Sorry To Bother You.  Addressing labor, masculinity, and technology through the lens of capitalism, we attempt to articulate the skillful work done by Riley in this satirical drama.
