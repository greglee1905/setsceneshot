excerpt: Are we going forward? Are we going backward? Is time circular? Are we autonomous? These are all questions asked by Nolan's newest movie, all the hype about it. Tenet. A palindrome in the title and the way it interacts with the viewer. 
summary: This week we tackle the intense world of Nolan with his most recent film, Tenet.  Falling within Nolan’s oeuvre of time-themed films, Tenet offers a holistic imagining of the causes and effects of linear time travel through a thoughtful score, intricate and complex plot details, and the imagining of this cinematic work in 70 mm and IMAX.  In this episode, we question Nolan’s commentary of power and history while also contextualizing Tenet in Nolan’s body of cinematic masterpieces.  Follow along this week as we detour from independent film to analyze this sci-fi thriller!
