excerpt: This week we combine the optical and the aural with Beyonce’s Lemonade, a visual album that accompanies her 6th studio album. A narrative that speaks to the individual in tandem with the collective, Lemonade offers a glimpse into the Black Female experience and generational trauma embellished with poetry, history, and culture. In this episode, we take a deep-dive into philosophical interpretations of the work, the criticism it received, and how Lemonade is a strategic pawn in the Knowles-Carter discography.
